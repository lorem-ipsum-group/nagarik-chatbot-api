What is Nagarik Mobile App?
Nagarik Mobile App is a software system that runs services on mobile and tablets. The Nagarik Mobile App is the beginning of a new era of digital Nepal. If the government continues to make this app more effective in the coming days, the era of paper documentation in Nepal will come to an end. The government has announced plans to build Digital Nepal for good governance, development, and prosperity. The citizen app envisioned by the government policy and program of 2075/76 is believed to be an important cornerstone for Digital Nepal. The online services of various government and public bodies can be easily accessed from the same app through this app, and this app will also act as a service delivery gateway so that the electronic systems of government and public bodies do not have to be interconnected separately to establish contact.

What is the slogan of the Nagarik App and When was it inaugurated?
The government has made it public on January 15, 2021, saying that it will provide "support of communication and information technology, government services hand in hand" to the citizens.
